# Background

Easily create apps that can be launched from the command line using the [Textual](https://github.com/Textualize/textual) library.

# Running an app

In the terminal enter the command `uv run app-name.py` where "app-name" is the name of the specific app.

# Motivation

Basically, to give Jonas a more accurate clock so that he can be even more punctual.
